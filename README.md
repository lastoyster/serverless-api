**Fully serverless app deployment**

Technologies:
**AWS Lambda**
**AWS S3**
**Node.js**
**Terraform**

This project demonstrates the deployment of a fully serverless Node.js API using Terraform for 
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. 
The goal is to run a production-grade backend API on AWS public cloud services using only managed, scalable, and serverless components along with Terraform as Infrastructure Modules.
